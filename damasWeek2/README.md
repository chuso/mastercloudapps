# Draughts week 2
Project for second week of Swoftware testing. Now we have seen how to work with mocks, so we are able to cover controllers, models and also views. This project is not fully functional, but it includes the initial design which allows us to work it out with our tests.

For example, there is no implementation for the `isFinished()` method in `Game` model.
